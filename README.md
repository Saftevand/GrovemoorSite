# Goofy little GitHub pages project
This is a little side project of a side project, that ended up in a tangent.

# Diclaimer
I am not a Front End expert, I can write it, but I can't design it.

## Stack
This is set up with a Blazor WebAssembly running .Net 9 with Tailwindcss implemented.
It is set up with some "basic" functionality for setting up different languages.

### Deployment
This project is set up with a GitHub Action to automatically deploy changes to GitHub Pages at https://jakobstryhn.github.io/ when pushing to Main. (Assuming it can build of course)

## Playground
Just little place to throw some random bips and bops.
I had to resize my profile picture to fit GitHubs 1mb limit, so I decided to make a SkiaSharp implementation.
